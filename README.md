# Accelerator Framework of Spike-by-Spike Neural Networks
SbS Framework is a hardware-software solution for rapid prototyping and deployment of Spike-by-Spike (SbS) Neural Networks with customizable hardware acceleration in embedded systems (FPGA).

The SbS Framework provides an object-oriented application programming interface (API) for SbS NN modeling, and performance/space exploration.

From the user perspective, the SbS neural network models are built as sequential layer containers, the framework backend performs data handling and hardware management for computation.
